/// RAMEN (Real-time Actor-based Message Exchange Network) is a very compact single-header C++20+ dependency-free
/// library that implements message-passing/flow-based programming for hard real-time mission-critical embedded systems.
/// It is designed to be very low-overhead, efficient, and easy to use. Please refer to the README for the docs.
///
/// The library includes the core functionality (the message passing ports) along with a few utilities for
/// practical message-passing programs.
///
/// The notation to define control flow, data flow, and relation between components is described here.
///
/// In diagrams, arrows represent the control flow direction: the pointed-to item is invoked by the pointing item.
/// Actors accept data inputs from the left and output data to the right.
/// A control input (the invoked item) is called a behavior, and a control output is called an event.
/// Overall this results in four possible combinations of input/output ports,
/// which can be used to arrange two dataflow models -- push (eager) and pull (lazy):
///
///     Port kind       Control     Data    Alias
///     --------------------------------------------
///      in-behavior    in          in      Pushable
///     out-event       out         out     Pusher
///     out-behavior    in          out     Pullable
///      in-event       out         in      Puller
///
/// Pull-model ports pair naturally with other pull-model ports, and the same for push-model ports.
/// To bridge push and pull models together, we use two basic components:
/// Latch (with behaviors on either side) and Lift (with events on either side and an additional trigger behavior);
/// they are defined below.
///
/// The following diagramming notation is adopted:
///
///                                +--------+
///   (input behavior) pushable -->|        |--> pusher (output event)
///                                | Actor  |
///      (input event) puller   <--|        |<-- pullable (output behavior)
///                                +--------+
///
/// The type of exchanged data can be arbitrary and it is possible to exchange more than one object per port.
/// Behaviors and Events can be linked together arbitrarily using operator>>; remember that the arrows point in the
/// direction of the control flow, not data flow. Within an actor, a behavior may trigger some events;
/// an event of an actor can trigger behaviors in other actors that it is linked to.
/// In some scenarios, the direction of the control flow does not matter on a bigger scale,
/// in which case one can use operator^ to link behaviors and events together irrespective of the control direction.
///
/// Events can be linked with behaviors and other events into topics. Given multiple events on a topic,
/// the resulting behavior is that any of the linked events will cause all linked behaviors to be triggered in
/// the order of linking. Topics that do not contain behaviors have no effect (events do not affect each other).
/// Behaviors cannot be linked directly without events.
///
/// Actors are usually implemented as structs with all data fields public. Public data does not hinder
/// encapsulation because actors are unable to affect or even see each other's data directly, as all interation is
/// done through message passing; this is the essence of the actor model. Hence, the encapsulation mechanisms provided
/// by C++ become redundant. This point only holds for pure actors, however; there may exist mixed classes that work
/// both as actors and as regular objects, in which case this recommendation may not apply
/// (whether it's a good practice to define such mixed classes is another matter).
///
/// Remember that recursive dependencies are common in actor networks, especially when they are used to implement
/// control systems. When implementing an actor, keep in mind that triggering any event to push or pull data can
/// cause the control flow to loop back to the current actor through a possibly very long chain of interactions.
/// Proper design should prevent the possibility of descending into an infinite recursion and also serving data
/// from an actor whose internal state is inconsistent. To avoid this class of errors, state updates should
/// always be performed in a transactional manner: first, all inputs are read, then the state is updated, and only
/// then the outputs are written. This is a general rule of thumb for designing such systems and is not specific
/// to this library. Improper design can cause an infinite recursion with a subsequent stack overflow and a segfault.
///
/// Pushable and Pusher accept const references to the passed data. It is not possible to pass non-const
/// references nor rvalue references because the data may be passed through a chain of actors, and it is necessary
/// to guarantee that each will receive the exact same data regardless of the order in which the actors are invoked.
///
/// Puller and Pullable accept mutable references to the data because the data is returned via out-parameters.
/// This is necessary to support the use case when the output type can only be assigned inside a port behavior,
/// but not constructed.
/// One practical case where this situation arises is returning Eigen::MatrixRef<> with at least one dynamic dimension.
///
/// Defining ports of highly specialized types is possible but rarely useful because specialized types impair
/// composability. For example, suppose there is a specialized configuration struct for some actor. The actor could
/// accept the configuration via an in-port and it would work, but the utility of this choice is limited because
/// in order to make use of this port, the other actor would need to have access to its specific type, at which point
/// the message passing aspect becomes redundant, as it would be easier to just pass/alter the configuration struct
/// directly (e.g., by mutating the state of the first actor). Instead, if the first actor were to accept configuration
/// via more granular in-ports of more generic types, like vectors, matrices, or whatever is common in the application,
/// then the composability of the solution would not be compromised.
///
/// Message passing enables a new approach to policy-based design. It is possible to ship predefined policies with
/// an actor by defining several behaviors, each implementing its own policy while sharing the same type.
/// The client will then choose which particular behavior (policy) to use at the time when the network is linked.
